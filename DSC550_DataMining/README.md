# Data Mining Final Project

**Course:** DSC 550 Data Mining  
**Tools Used:** Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook  

## Overview
This final project explores real-world data mining techniques by applying clustering, classification, and/or association rule mining to extract patterns from complex datasets. The notebook demonstrates the end-to-end data mining process from data import to model evaluation.

## Key Techniques Used
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Clustering and segmentation analysis
- Predictive modeling (e.g., decision trees or k-NN)
- Model evaluation and visualization

## Outcome
This project highlights practical application of data mining concepts using real data. It emphasizes both unsupervised and supervised learning techniques to extract actionable insights, showing the ability to turn raw data into useful knowledge.
