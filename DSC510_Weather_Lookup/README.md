**Course:** DSC 510 Introduction to Programming  
**Tools Used:** Python, Requests API, OpenWeatherMap API  

## Overview
This program allows users to look up real-time weather by zip code or by city/state using the OpenWeatherMap API. The program retrieves and displays current weather conditions including temperature, humidity, pressure, and a short description.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- API integration and error handling
- Function-driven programming structure
- Input validation and looping
- User experience design in CLI

## Outcome
The program accurately fetches weather data using both zip code and city/state, allows for unit conversions, and runs in a loop to support multiple lookups. It's a clean example of applying Python fundamentals to a real-world use case.
