# 🚀 DSC680 – Mars Mission Cost Forecasting

This project estimates the cost of future Mars missions using simulated data, linear regression modeling, and Monte Carlo simulation. The analysis was conducted as part of the final project for DSC 680: Applied Data Science.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project was to:
- Create a synthetic dataset simulating 250 potential Mars missions
- Use linear regression to predict mission cost based on variables like payload mass, development time, and vehicle type
- Run a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the range and distribution of expected future mission costs
- Communicate findings through a white paper and visual presentation

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- GitHub

## 📈 Key Findings
- **Vehicle type** and **payload mass** were the strongest predictors of mission cost.
- The regression model achieved an **R² of 0.91**, suggesting strong predictive performance.
- Simulated missions had an average estimated cost of ~$4.9B USD, ranging from $848M to $9.3B.

## 🧪 Methods
- **Synthetic data generation** was used to simulate realistic future missions using plausible ranges from NASA and SpaceX data.
- **Regression modeling** helped forecast mission costs based on independent variables.
- **Monte Carlo simulation** projected the distribution of future costs under varying scenarios.

## 💬 Questions Answered
- What drives the cost of a Mars mission?
- How can we estimate cost before actual missions launch?
- How might cost distributions shift as vehicle tech evolves?
