# Data Storytelling: Childcare Cost Trends

**Course:** DSC 640 Data Visualization  
**Tools Used:** Power BI, Canva, PowerPoint, R (earlier milestones)  

## Overview
This project explores data from the National Database of Childcare Prices and presents findings in three mediums: a Power BI dashboard, an infographic, and a policy brief-style presentation. Each medium targets a different audience, demonstrating the power of visual storytelling to inform policy and raise awareness around childcare affordability.

## Mediums
- **Power BI Dashboard**: Interactive dashboard for analysts and stakeholders with line charts, maps, and bar graphs tracking childcare costs over time and by state.
- **Infographic**: One-page visual summary for working parents and general audiences. Highlights key takeaways and cost gaps by age group.
- **Slide Deck (Policy Brief)**: Concise presentation for policymakers and nonprofit leaders. Focuses on recommendations and state-level cost comparisons.

## Key Insights
- States vary dramatically in cost, especially for infant care.
- Costs have risen steadily since 2018, with the largest increases in certain age groups.
- Policymakers need to address affordability through funding and regulation.
