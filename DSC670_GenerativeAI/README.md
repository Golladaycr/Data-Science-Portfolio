# Prompt Engineering for a Generative AI Fitness Coach

**Course:** DSC 670 Applied AI  
**Tools Used:** Python, OpenAI API (GPT-4), Prompt Engineering  

## Overview
This project explores how different prompt styles can influence responses from GPT-4 in the context of a simulated fitness coaching assistant. The goal was to experiment with coaching tone, detail, empathy, and long-term strategy to create a personalized AI that could help guide users toward health goals — specifically visible abs by October.

## Prompts Tested
1. **Empathetic Coaching Style**
2. **Tough-Love Trainer Voice**
3. **Funny but Honest Advice**
4. **Tactical, Data-Driven Feedback**
5. **Long-Term Vision Framing**

Each prompt used the same structured fitness log input (weight, calories, macros, mood, and workout) and elicited a unique response to evaluate GPT’s coaching adaptability.

## Outcome
This project demonstrated GPT-4's flexibility and emotional range when responding to structured input. It also laid the groundwork for future experiments in real-time AI coaching systems driven by user health data.
