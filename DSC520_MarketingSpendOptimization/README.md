# Marketing Spend Optimization

**Course:** DSC 680 Applied Data Science  
**Tools Used:** Python (for simulation), R (for EDA and visualization), ggplot2, dplyr, tidyverse  

## Overview
This project simulates marketing data to analyze and optimize how marketing budgets are allocated across digital channels (Google Paid Search, Edmunds, Carfax, etc.) in the automotive retail industry. It explores ROI, cost per lead, seasonal trends, customer segments, and franchise-level performance.

## Key Questions Explored
- Which vendors provide the highest ROI?
- How does lead quality vary by channel?
- Whatâ€™s the cost per lead and sale by source?
- Are there seasonal spend/conversion patterns?

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Simulated data generation and transformation
- Time-series and ROI analysis
- Visualization with R (scatter plots, box plots, time series)
- Data cleaning, feature engineering, and insights presentation

## Outcome
The analysis uncovered channel ROI rankings, seasonal effectiveness, customer segment value, and regional spend performance. This project could be extended to include predictive models that forecast conversion likelihood or optimize spend dynamically.
