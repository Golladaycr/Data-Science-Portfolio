# Data Preparation and Feature Engineering (Milestone 5)

**Course:** DSC 540 Data Preparation  
**Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook  

## Overview
This project demonstrates a full pipeline of data preparation techniques, including missing value handling, data transformation, feature selection, and encoding strategies. It represents a key milestone in preparing datasets for predictive modeling.

## Key Techniques Used
- Missing value imputation
- Outlier detection and treatment
- Data normalization and scaling
- One-hot encoding and feature engineering
- Dataset splitting for model readiness

## Outcome
By the end of the notebook, the dataset was fully cleaned and engineered, ready for machine learning applications. It showcases best practices in data prep and highlights my ability to transform raw datasets into model-ready form.
