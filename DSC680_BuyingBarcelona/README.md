# Buying Barcelona: A Housing Affordability Analysis

**Course:** DSC 680 Applied Data Science  
**Tools Used:** Python (Jupyter Notebook), Kaggle (Idealista), Numbeo, ECB, PowerPoint  

## Overview
This project explores property affordability in Barcelona, Spain — a hotspot for foreign real estate investment. By analyzing housing prices, income levels, and mortgage burden, the project asks: “Is Barcelona still affordable for the average buyer?”

## Data Sources
- **Idealista (Kaggle)**: Property prices, size, amenities
- **Numbeo**: Net income, rent, affordability metrics
- **INE Spain**: Mortgage data, average wages
- **ECB**: Historical EUR exchange rates

## Key Insights
- The average Barcelona home costs €530,460.
- Locals would need 24 years of income to buy the average property.
- Mortgage burden is 88.9%, with an affordability index of 1.12 → strained.
- Affordability varies significantly by neighborhood.

## Ethical Considerations
- The analysis avoids encouraging gentrification by contextualizing results.
- It critiques policies that favor speculative foreign investment over affordability for residents.

## Deliverables
- PowerPoint presentation
- (Optional: Jupyter Notebook, CSV if available)
