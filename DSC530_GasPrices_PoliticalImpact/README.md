# Gas Prices & Political Influence: A Data Exploration

**Course:** DSC 530 Data Exploration and Analysis  
**Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  

## Overview
This project investigates whether gas prices in the U.S. are influenced more by political leadership or by economic forces like crude oil prices, GDP, and inflation (CPI). Using data from 1950 to 2023, I analyzed gas prices across political parties and economic conditions to uncover significant relationships and trends.

## Key Questions
- Are gas prices lower under Democratic or Republican presidents?
- How do gas prices correlate with GDP, CPI, and crude oil prices?
- Is the political party in power a statistically significant factor?

## Key Techniques
- Data cleaning and merging across five sources
- Histograms, CDFs, PMFs, and scatter plots
- Descriptive statistics and regression modeling
- Permutation hypothesis testing

## Key Findings
- Gas prices correlate strongly with crude oil prices, GDP, and CPI (r > 0.93).
- Political party has **minimal** influence on gas prices.
- Hypothesis testing showed **no statistically significant** difference between Democratic and Republican terms (p = 0.277).
- Regression modeling confirms economic factors are primary drivers of gas prices.
