# Predictive Analytics with Health & Fitness Tracking

**Course:** DSC 630 Predictive Analytics  
**Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook, PDF Report  

## Overview
This project uses personal health tracking data — including weight, calorie intake, workout routines, and body fat percentage — to build predictive models that estimate when target body composition goals will be reached. It demonstrates real-world application of regression modeling and performance evaluation techniques.

## Key Techniques Used
- Time series and regression modeling
- RMSE and R-squared evaluation
- Data wrangling and trend analysis
- Visual insights and forecasting

## Outcome
The final models helped estimate the timeframe to reach 12% body fat based on historical trends and daily metrics. This work blends personal motivation with technical modeling, showcasing how predictive analytics can be applied to wellness goals.
